# Privacy Policy — Angry Animals

Last updated: 2025-12-30

## Overview
Angry Animals is a physics-based puzzle game. This privacy policy explains what data the app uses and stores.

## Data we store on your device
Angry Animals stores the following **locally on your device**:
- **Gameplay progress** (e.g. unlocked levels, scores, star ratings)
- **Cosmetic selections** (e.g. hats, glasses, emotions)
- **Full game unlock status** (whether the non-consumable purchase is owned)
- **Optional face image** (if you choose to capture or select an image for customization)

This data is stored in the app’s sandbox (e.g. `user://profile.json` and `user://faces/*`).

## Data we do not collect
We do **not** require you to create an account.
We do **not** collect your name, email address, or precise location.
We do **not** sell personal data.

## Ads
The free tier may show ads.
- Ads are provided by third-party ad networks (e.g. Google AdMob), depending on which mobile plugin/build configuration is used.
- Ad networks may collect device identifiers and other information to deliver ads, subject to their own privacy policies.

If you purchase the **Full Game Unlock**, ads are disabled.

## In-app purchases
Purchases are processed by the Apple App Store / Google Play and are subject to Apple/Google account settings and policies.
We receive confirmation of purchase ownership via the store APIs, and we store a local "unlocked" flag.

## Camera / Photo Library
If you use face customization:
- The camera and/or photo library is used to let you capture or select an image.
- The image is stored locally on your device.
- The image is not uploaded by Angry Animals.

## Children’s privacy
Angry Animals is intended for a general audience.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Data deletion
You can delete all locally stored data by uninstalling the app.
