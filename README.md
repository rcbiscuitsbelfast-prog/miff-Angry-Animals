## Setup and Build

### Prerequisites
1. **Godot Engine 4.4.x** - Download from [godotengine.org](https://godotengine.org/download)
2. **.NET 6.0 SDK** - Download from [dotnet.microsoft.com](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
3. Git (to clone the repository)

### How to Run

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Angry-Animals

# Open in Godot
# 1. Launch Godot Engine
# 2. Click "Import" or "Open Project"
# 3. Select to project.godot file
# 4. Click Play (F5) to run the game
```

### Building for Distribution

1. Open the project in Godot 4.4
2. Go to **Project > Export...**
3. Add export presets for your target platform:

## Monetization Setup

### AdMob Configuration

1. **Register your app** in [AdMob Console](https://apps.admob.com)
2. **Create ad unit IDs** for:
   - Interstitial ads
   - Rewarded ads
3. **Update AdsManager.cs** with your AdMob App ID and ad unit IDs:

```csharp
// In AdsManager.cs, add:
private const string AdMobAppId = "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX~YYYYYYYYYY";
private const string InterstitialAdUnitId = "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/ZZZZZZZZZZ";
private const string RewardedAdUnitId = "ca-app-pub-XXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYY";
```

4. **For Android**: Add the AdMob App ID to `AndroidManifest.xml`
5. **For iOS**: Add the AdMob App ID to `Info.plist`

See [MONETIZATION_SETUP.md](MONETIZATION_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### In-App Purchase Setup

1. **Configure IAP** in your respective store consoles:
   - **iOS**: [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
   - **Android**: [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. **Create a product** with ID: `com.yourcompany.angryanimals.fullunlock`
3. **Update MonetizationManager.cs** with your product ID:

```csharp
// In MonetizationManager.cs
private const string FullUnlockProductId = "com.yourcompany.angryanimals.fullunlock";
```

4. **Test purchases** with sandbox accounts before going live

### Free vs Paid Tiers

- **Free Tier**: Levels 1-20 are playable without purchase
- **Paid Tier**: Unlock all 100 levels with one-time purchase
- Players can watch rewarded ads for bonus points
- AdMob ads are shown between levels

## Asset Customization

### Customizing Assets

The game references several asset directories. To customize:

1. **Textures/Sprites**: Replace or add images in the `Assets/` directory (if added)
2. **Audio Files**: Add `.ogg` or `.wav` files for sounds and music
3. **Face Customization Images**: Add custom face images to the gallery

### Asset Paths (to be configured in scenes):

- **Projectile sprites**: Update `res://Assets/Characters/`
- **Cup/obstacle sprites**: Update `res://Assets/Obstacles/`
- **UI icons**: Update `res://Assets/UI/`
- **Background music**: Update `res://Assets/Audio/Music/`
- **Sound effects**: Update `res://Assets/Audio/SFX/`

## Development

### Key Systems

**Autoloaded Managers (Globals/):**
- **GameManager**: Manages game state (Boot, MainMenu, InRoom, Paused)
- **ScoreManager**: Tracks scores and handles save/load to JSON
- **SignalManager**: Centralized event routing using C# signals
- **PlayerProfile**: Manages cosmetics, progress, and unlock state
- **AudioManager**: Handles audio playback and volume controls
- **AdsManager**: Manages AdMob ad display
- **MonetizationManager**: Handles in-app purchases

**Gameplay Scripts (Script/):**
- **RoomBase**: Orchestrates room flow (slingshot → traversal → completion)
- **Slingshot**: Drag-and-release mechanics with physics
- **Projectile**: Base RigidBody2D for launched objects
- **StickClone**: Traversal phase character with face customization
- **MainMenu**: Main menu navigation and settings
- **GameHud**: In-game UI (attempts, rage bar, combo counter)
- **LevelCompleted**: Post-level summary and star ratings

### Signal-Based Architecture

The game uses a centralized signal system for loose coupling:

```csharp
// In SignalManager.cs
[Signal] public delegate void OnAnimalDiedEventHandler();
[Signal] public delegate void OnAttemptMadeEventHandler();
[Signal] public delegate void OnCupDestroyedEventHandler();
[Signal] public delegate void OnLevelCompletedEventHandler();
[Signal] public delegate void OnDestructionScoreUpdatedEventHandler(int score);
```

Scripts subscribe to events they care about:

```csharp
SignalManager.Instance.OnCupDestroyed += OnCupDestroyed;
SignalManager.Instance.OnLevelCompleted += OnLevelCompleted;
```

### Save System

Scores and progress are saved to JSON in the user data directory:

```csharp
// Location: ~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Angry Animals/level_scores.json
{
  "Room001": {"score": 3, "stars": 3},
  "Room002": {"score": 2, "stars": 2}
}
```
